          Naomi is a 20 year old designer from Melbourne.
          <br><br>
          In her free time she likes to dance, read and spend time with her friends.
          <br><br>
          Naomi specialises in more print based mediums, for example: branding, publication and advertising, however she is also competent in a few multimedia disciplines: video editing (Final Cut Pro and Premiere Pro), and coding (HTML and CSS). When she designs, she prefers to use photography and typography to convey the message.
          <br><br>
          She is very excited to start working in the design industry and has been working hard to pick up odd jobs to help strengthen her folio.

          <p class="date">2018</p>
          <p>In 2018 I was elected to be one of two <i>Publicity Officers</i> for Monash Dancesport. This meant that I was in charge of Design and Marketing for the club. I started by creating a new logo for the club, as the new one was quite outdated, and throughout the year created a number of graphics to support and advertise upcoming events. A few that I am particularly proud of are the posters for our <i>Performance Night</i> and <i>Annual Ball</i>, and the promo video that I also made for the ball.</p>

          <p class="date">January — April 2019</p>
          <p>In early 2019 I was approached by a young, freelance cartographer to create a logo for his freelancing business, Bespoke Maps & Data. He requested something simple and classic that also spoke about the kind of work he does. The triangle represents markers commonly used by cartographers to help with distance accuracy when creating maps.</p>

          <p>This identity was created for the Stratford on the River Festival. It encompassed a logotype, posters, programmes and various merchandise items (that vary in colour-ways) and flags for signage.</p>

          <p>The Shakespeare on the River festival has two themes every year that relate to their writing and art competitions. For 2018, they were <i>'For the love of Shakespeare'</i> and <i>'The Tempest'</i>. The majority of the merchandising is surrounding these themes with the intention of change year to year (i.e. the anchor — relating to <i>'The Tempest'</i> — and the heart — relating to <i>'For the love of Shakespeare'</i> — would be swapped out for other imagery relavent to the year's themes).</p>

          <p>For my final studio at university I created an identity for the 1970's Australian play <i>A Stretch of the Imagination</i>, written by Jack Hibberd.</p>
          <p>I modelled the overall aesthetic on two strong components of Australian theatre that I felt that <i>Stretch</i> uses a lot: Aussie vernacular and the use of mundane environments to express deep concepts.</p>

          <p class="date">Semester 1, 2019</p>
          <p><i>Where did all the Puritans go?</i> is a response to a brief in my 3rd year <i>When</i> studio, that asked us to deep dive through Wikipedia hyperlinks until we settled on a page. We were then asked to document the contents of that page (and any other relevant webpages) as a design outcome. I decided to create a mockumentary – themed like an episode of "You can't ask that" – based around Puritanism: a Christian denomination that died out in the 1600's.</p>

          <p class="date">Semester 1, 2019</p>
          <p>This brief asked us to take a public webpage and publish it physically without it being a book. So I took Jaden Smith’s twitter feed (known for his “woke” and strange quotes) and turned them into stickers that I placed in areas where graffiti and other “woke” quotes may be seen.</p>
          <p>A big part of this project was shock factor, and to get people asking about it. Since these stickers have been placed in bathrooms around Monash University Clayton and on people’s possessions. I have heard a lot of feedback that people have commented and been bemused by them.</p>
