          <h1>Naomi Etheridge</h1>
          <br><br>
          Naomi is a 20 year old designer from Melbourne.
          <br><br>
          In her free time she likes to dance, read and spend time with her friends.
          <br><br>
          Naomi specialises in more print based mediums, for example: branding, publication and advertising, however she is also competent in a few multimedia disciplines: video editing (Final Cut Pro and Premiere Pro), and coding (HTML and CSS). When she designs, she prefers to use photography and typography to convey the message.
          <br><br>
          She is very excited to start working in the design industry and has been working hard to pick up odd jobs to help strengthen her folio.
